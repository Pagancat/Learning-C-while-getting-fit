# Learning-C-while-getting-fit

Needed to loose weight and improve my fitness. I wanted to learn C++ as well so I decided to kill two birds with one stone and write a program to help me excercise. As I have learned new things in C++ I have added to the program and will contimue to add to it as I go along. Probably not the most elegant program in the world and if anyone has any tips as to how to msake it look neater I would be grateful.
